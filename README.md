### 

I am Per from Norway. ðŸ‘‹

As a beginner in the world of coding, I'm eager to learn as much as I can about web development, Vue.js, and blockchain.

I'm passionate about sharing my journey with others and hope to inspire others to join me in learning and growing as developers.
Follow me as I navigate the ups and downs of learning to code and building projects from the ground up."
